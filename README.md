In today’s world, it is important to understand your overall health and be able to make predictions about health issues such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. We will be using Machine Learning to predict whether an individual has diabetes, is prediabetic or would most likely not have diabetes. We will use information such as the person’s age, BMI, activity levels etc.

Research Questions:

1. Can the machine learning model accurately predict diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-diabetes, and what factors contribute to this accuracy?
2. Can our machine learning model be trained on a small subset of clinical data to accurately predict diabetes, pre-diabetes, and non-diabetes in a larger population, and how does its performance compare to models trained on larger datasets?
3. Can specific subgroups within the population (e.g., age, BMI, physical activity, etc.) be identified and addressed in order to improve the model's performance overall?
4. Can the machine learning model be used to identify potential risk factors for diabetes and pre-diabetes, and how can this information be used to improve clinical interventions and patient outcomes?
